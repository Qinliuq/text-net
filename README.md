*Text-mining using complex network ideologies* 

Written text can be viewed as a complex network based on word adjacency: each word is a node in the network; if two words are nearest neighbour (the distance can be modified for various purposes), we draw an edge to connect the two nodes.

More source codes and theoretical works are coming.
